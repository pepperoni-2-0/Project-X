            # JEEVAN Application - Standalone Offline Executables
            
            This release contains the fully-offline standalone executable versions of the JEEVAN application.
            
            ### How to use:
            1. Download the file appropriate for your Operating System:
               - **Windows**: `jeevan-windows-x64.exe`
               - **macOS (Apple Silicon/M1/M2)**: `jeevan-macos-arm64`
               - **macOS (Intel)**: `jeevan-macos-x64`
               - **Linux**: `jeevan-linux-x64`
            2. Place the executable in a folder of your choice.
            3. Double-click to run! 
            
            **⚠️ macOS Users ("Cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"):**
            Because this is an indie executable without an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it by default. 
            To run it:
            1. Locate the file in Finder.
            2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the file, and click **Open**. 
            3. A new popup will appear with an **"Open"** button. Click it.
            
            *(Alternatively, run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <filename>` in your terminal).*
            
            The application will automatically launch your browser and navigate to the local server, persisting data automatically to a `jeevan-data/` folder created securely next to it.
